Introduction
============


If you would like to get a good grade for your project, you have to write a good report.  Your project will be assessed mostly based on the report. Examiners are not mind-readers, and cannot give credit for work which you have done but not included in the report [York2017].

Here is the Stanford InfoLab's patented five-point structure for Introductions. Unless there's a good argument against it, the Introduction should consist of five paragraphs answering the following five questions:

- What is the problem?
- Why is it interesting and important? What do you gain when you solve the problem, and what do you miss if you do not solve it?
- Why is it hard? (e.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
- Why hasn't it been solved before? What's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does yours differ?
- What are the key components of your approach and results including any specific limitations.


Then have a penultimate paragraph or subsection: "Contributions". It should list the major contributions in bullet form, mentioning in which sections they can be found. This material doubles as an outline of the rest of the paper, saving space and eliminating redundancy.

The last paragraph should provide the outline of the paper/report.
