Abstract

Write your abstract here.

An abstract summarizes, in one paragraph (usually), the major aspects of the entire paper/report in the following prescribed sequence [Anderson2016]:

- the question(s) you investigated (or purpose), (from Introduction)
- state the purpose very clearly in the first or second sentence.
- the experimental design and methods used; clearly express the basic design of the study; name or briefly describe the basic methodology used without going into excessive detail-be sure to indicate the key techniques used.
- the major findings including key quantitative results, or trends; report those results which answer the questions you were asking; identify trends, relative change or differences, etc.
- a brief summary of your interpretations and conclusions; clearly state the implications of the answers your results gave you.


The length of your Abstract should be kept to about 200-300 words maximum. Limit your statements concerning each segment of the paper (i.e. purpose, methods, results, etc.) to two or three sentences. The Abstract helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper, or it may be the only part they can obtain via electronic literature searches or in published abstracts. Therefore, enough key information (e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.) must be included to make the Abstract useful to someone who may to reference your work~\cite{Anderson2016}.

How do you know when you have enough information in your Abstract? A simple rule-of-thumb is to imagine that you are another researcher doing an study similar to the one you are reporting. If your Abstract was the only part of the paper you could access, would you be happy with the information presented there?

The Abstract is ONLY text. Use the active voice when possible, but much of it may require passive constructions. Write your Abstract using concise, but complete, sentences, and get to the point quickly. The Abstract SHOULD NOT contain~\cite{Anderson2016}:

-  lengthy background information,
-  references to other literature,
-  elliptical (i.e., ending with ...) or incomplete sentences,
-  abbreviations or (mathematical) terms that may be confusing to readers,
-  any sort of illustration, figure, or table, or references to them.
